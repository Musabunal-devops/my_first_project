Project Concept:

Interactive Online CV Platform
This project aims to develop a dynamic web platform that revolutionizes the traditional online CV. Users will be able to upload their resumes and organize them into distinct, categorized sections (e.g., Experience, Education, Skills).

A key feature will be the interactive feedback system, allowing other users (such as recruiters, mentors, or peers) to leave comments and provide constructive feedback directly on specific sections of a CV. This collaborative environment will help users refine their professional profiles and gain valuable insights from a diverse audience, making the CV not just a static document but a living, evolving representation of their career.
